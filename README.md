# processing_sketches
Repository with my processing sketches, with some generative art / creative coding. The creative coding community is so open towards sharing code, and I want to share mine as well - but I didn't want to make them short as a tweet. So, here it is. I hope this sketch collection gets to grow!

## Procedural Rotations

I found a beautiful line motion from @incre_ment on Twitter, with a kindly shared source code. So I used a similar motion to make something else.
