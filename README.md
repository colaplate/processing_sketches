# processing_sketches
Repository with my processing sketches, with some generative art / creative coding. The creative coding community is so open towards sharing code, and I want to share mine as well - but I didn't want to make them short as a tweet. So, here it is. I hope this sketch collection gets to grow!

## Frequency Modulation

Our vibes change in opposition to each other. Still, we are all alike.

## Colorful Disk in Space

This began when I was studying arcs. Then I wanted arcs that open and close. Then, I added arc layers. And I found out that arcs can be elliptical instead of round. And I wanted more moving arcs, and then the moving arcs move, and finally the background got some noise. This looks a bit vintage, like a science fiction movie from the 70's or 80's.

## Procedural Rotations

I found a beautiful line motion from @incre_ment on Twitter, with a kindly shared source code. So I used a similar motion to make something else.
